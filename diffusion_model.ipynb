    "Sampling was trickiest because we barely covered it in the lecture. We knew the general idea is to feed in a noise vector and then iteratively denoise it but how to do so was not clear. The breakthrough occurred when we realized the process can be viewed as solving a stochastic differential equation (SDE), specifically a variance preserving SDE. Framing it this way made it clear why we have a $\\sigma_t$ term and what the denoising equation is doing."
